Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. If you were working on multiple machines or others were working on changes to the same files you are.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. In case changes are in process, you may not get the changes in a timely fashion if you are using auto. Plus, you can pull on demand if you have others who are in a remote location making changes.
