Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. If you were working on multiple machines or others were working on changes to the same files you are.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. In case changes are in process, you may not get the changes in a timely fashion if you are using auto. Plus, you can pull on demand if you have others who are in a remote location making changes.

Q. Describe the difference between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another
A.	Fork - On GitHub, when cloning another repository in to your own profile
A.	Clone - After forking a repository on GitHub, copying the contents of that copied repository to your local machine.
A.	Branch - On GitHub or on local machine, a sway from the master branch where experimental changes can be done and checked before merging back to the master.

Q. What is a benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A. In case changes were introduced that you didn't want, you could always revert to the last known state.
